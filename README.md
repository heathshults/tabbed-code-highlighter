## Code

This component is the code highlighter of [Framebox].

It is developed with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com) and use [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com) from [James DiGioia](https://twitter.com/jamesdigioia) for the highlighting itself.

## Getting Started

Start you new presentation by following the quick  ðŸ‘‰ [Getting Started guide](https://docs.framebox.com/docs) ðŸ‘ˆ

## Example
   
The [framebox website](https://github.com/framebox/framebox-website) is a full featured presentation developed with [framebox].

## Standalone

To create easily your PWA presentation and to enjoy all the options, I suggest you to use the starter kit as described in the [documentation](https://docs.framebox.com/docs).

However, if you are looking to use this Web Component as a standalone component, to add a code highlighter feature to your web applications, follow its dedicated [guide](https://docs.framebox.com/components/code).
