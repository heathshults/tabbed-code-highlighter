# @heathenscript - Tabbed Code Highlighter

This is a web component compiled with Stencil.js and the [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) framework. This component is created with love from my buddies Typescript, HTML and CSS. Other than that, this is one of my first projects in the web component realm. I thought ``` Another code highlighter, why not! ```

## Highlight Code

If you like code you will like this. And even if you don't it's still pretty cool.

It is a combination of [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com) and [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com). Thank you [James DiGioia](https://twitter.com/jamesdigioia) for the highlighting itself.

## Getting Started

There is really nothing to it. See below. 

## Example
   
The [framebox website](https://github.com/framebox/framebox-website) is a full featured presentation developed with [framebox].

## Standalone

To create easily your PWA presentation and to enjoy all the options, I suggest you to use the starter kit as described in the [documentation](https://docs.framebox.com/docs).

However, if you are looking to use this Web Component as a standalone component, to add a code highlighter feature to your web applications, follow its dedicated [guide](https://docs.framebox.com/components/code).

## Develop

To develop and run this Web Component locally, proceed as following:

```
git clone https://github.com/framebox/framebox-highlight-code
cd framebox-highlight-code
npm install
npm run start
```
