THIS IS FROM BOOTSTRAP

## Team

framekit is maintained by a [small team of developers](https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people) on GitHub. We're actively looking to grow this team and would love to hear from you if you're excited about CSS at scale, writing and maintaining vanilla JavaScript plugins, and improving build tooling processes for frontend code.

## History

Originally created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, framekit has become one of the most popular front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world.

framekit was created at Twitter in mid-2010 by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [@fat](https://twitter.com/fat). Prior to being an open-sourced framework, framekit was known as _Twitter Blueprint_. A few months into development, Twitter held its [first Hack Week](https://blog.twitter.com/2010/hack-week) and the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped in without any external guidance. It served as the style guide for internal tools development at the company for over a year before its public release, and continues to do so today.

Originally [released](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/a/2011/framekit-twitter.html) on <time datetime="2011-08-19 11:25">Friday, August 19, 2011</time>, we've since had over [twenty releases]({{ shared.repo }}/releases), including two major rewrites with v2 and v3. With framekit 2, we added responsive functionality to the entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that with framekit 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile first approach.

With framekit 4, we once again rewrote the project to account for two key architectural changes: a migration to Sass and the move to CSS's flexbox. Our intention is to help in a small way to move the web development community forward by pushing for newer CSS properties, fewer dependencies, and new technologies across more modern browsers.
